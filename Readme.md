# Drum 🥁 Kit
## It's a fun website that contains all the instruments that you'll ever need in a Drum Kit. 
## It basically has seven instruments printed and if you click on any of the instrument picture, you'll hear an instrumental sound that resembles it. So basically its a virtual drum kit if you dont wanna get an actual one 😄
## The kit can also be controlled through your keyboard, whichever instrument you wanna play, just press the key printed on it and VOILA it's done!
## Happy Coding!
